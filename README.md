This app is a questionnaire i developped for the Kinneret academy college.
The app offers a simple way for teachers to get feedback on their courses.
Teachers can add/remove questions and courses+clear all accumulated scores. 
The users then need to rate each course from 1-5, and they can do it only once. 

There are 2 type of users-admins and regular users.
for now the only way to sign up as an admin is via firestore for security reasons.
However, the registration page still allows students/regular users to sign up and vote.

Admin example: 
user: ishay7@gmail.com 
password:123456

Regular user:
user: newuser@gmail.com
password: asdasd
